# TopicModeling
This is a topic modeling code developed to identify top most topics in research papers analyzed

This text mining analysis using topic modeling uncovered the prominent topics in transportation and logistics research. Latent Dirichlet allocation, a probabilistic modeling technique, provided comprehensive thematic analysis of the academic literature (Sun & Yin, 2017). The model identified ten distinct topics represented by key terms.

Topic modeling enables discovery of latent themes within text, granting a holistic view of the field's focus (Korshunova et al., 2019). Analyzing topic prevalence reveals high-interest areas for researchers and industry. This analysis prioritizes optimization methods, machine learning applications, and emerging technologies as active research domains (Ma & Kim, 2023).

Thoughtful interpretation labeled each statistically derived topic, converting abstract concepts into meaningful themes (Wallach, 2006). The interactive visualization aids interpretation, with topic proximity indicating similarity. Adjusting the relevance metric highlights niche or common terms within topics (Silbernagel et al., 2023).

This methodology delivered multifaceted insights. It revealed core subject areas, relationships between topics, and variability based on modeling parameters. Overall, topic modeling provided a data-driven perspective on research themes and priorities in transportation and logistics.
